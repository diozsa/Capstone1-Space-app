    If you have not seen the full night sky in a while,
    here you can get a glipse of what's out there, 
    in close virtual proximity to many celestial bodies and much more.
    <br>
    I hope your curiousity will be piqued!

    The site has 4 main parts:
    <ul class="lead text-justify">
        <li>NASA Images - a service provided by NASA that allows 
            searches on their image database. Once the image is loaded, click on it for more info.
            <br>
            For instance, try looking up some fascinating astronomical objects from the 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-s-messier-catalog">Messier catalog</a> - 
            you won't be disspointed.
        </li>
        <li>APOD - Astronomy Picture of the DAY - an image/video file updated daily by NASA</li>
        <li>Perseverance Rover - With currently over 100,000 images available from this rover,
            Perseverance is the latest rover deployed on Mars.
            It has 15 cameras on board dedicated to specific imaging tasks. The app randomly selects
            a sol (Mars day) out of the total number of days the rover has been active
            and retrives pictures from different cameras. The information comes in bulk - 
            some pictures are better than others.
            But these are images straight from the surface of Mars!   
        </li>
        <li>
            Your Image Collection - When using the NASA images search tool 
            you could save your favorite pictures in the database, if you are logged in. 
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

    Enjoy your space trip!
